<h3>What is a callback</h3>
<p>
    A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function. Using callbacks makes it possible
    to perfom reuse common behaviaor while at the same time addin new behavior. Another usecase is passing a callback
    to a asynchronous function, which could then call the supplied function at a later point in time. 
</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
    A common usecase is wanting to perfom some operating after a specific amount of time. JavaScript includes a function called
    <em>setTimeout</em> which has two parameters, one for callback and another for the amount of time that should be passed before
    the callback is invoked. See the example below, which contains two approaches to the same problem, one that uses an anonymous function
    and another which uses a regular function.

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        function printHello() {
            console.log("Hello");
        }

        // prints "hello" after 1 second using a regular function passed as callback
        setTimeout(printHello, 1000); 

        // prints "hello" after 2 seconds using an anonymous function passed as callback
        setTimeout(() => console.log("Hello"), 2000);
    </code>
