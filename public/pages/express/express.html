<h3>What is Express</h3>
<p>
    Express is a Node.js web framework. You can use it to setup and run a server written in JavaScript. 
    Express supports both static files and server side rendering. You can also create an API, where you send JSON as a response.
</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
    Open the terminal in your project folder and type <em>npm install express</em>.
    This will install the newest version of Express.
</p>
<h3>Quick start</h3>
<p>
    See the following code to get a server running. 
</p>
<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        const express = require("express"); //import express
        const app = express(); // create and assign an Express applican object which contains various functions

        // start the server and make it listen on port 8080, optionally pass it a callback which will be run
        // when the server starts
        app.listen(8080, () => console.log("Server is running on port", 8080)); 
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    This above code starts a server which listens for HTTP requests on port 8080. There isn't actually any routes yet. 
    See the following sections for how to create routes and different types of responses.
</p>
<h3>Routes generally</h3>
<p>
    To create a route, write the following code.
</p>
<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        // the first parameter is the endpoint and the second is a callback function
        // the callback function should have two parameters. The first parameter (here called req)
        // will contain a request object, while the second (res) will contain a response object. 
        app.get("/hello", (req, res) {
            //process request and send some response
        });
    </code>
</pre>
<pre>
    In the above example, the route is for a HTTP GET request. The Express application object
    similarily contains functions for other types of HTTP reqests like POST, PUT etc.
    How to send a response depends on the type of content and whether you want to use
    SSR or send static files.
</pre>
<h3>Send a JSON response</h3>
<p>To send a JSON response, simply do it like the below code.</p>
<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        app.get("/get-json", (req, res) {
            res.send({
                property1 : "some value",
                property2 : "another value"
            });
        });
    </code>
</pre>
<h3>Send a static html file</h3>
<p>To send a HTML file without any modification, do it like below</p>
<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        app.get("/get-html", (req, res) {
            res.sendFile("/somePath");
        });
    </code>
</pre>
<h3>Server side rendering</h3>
<p>
    If you want to dynamically modify a HTML file before sending it with the response, 
    you can do it using the below code.
</p>

<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        const fs = require("fs");
        // next three lines: load relevant HTML files and store them as strings
        const nav = fs.readFileSync("/pathToNavHtmlFile").toString();
        const footer = fs.readFileSync("/pathToFooterHtmlFile").toString();
        const getSSR = fs.readFileSync("pathToMainContentHtmlFile").toString();
        
        // replace values in stored strings (from HTML files) and concatenate them.
        // In this case, we concatenate our main HTML file with a header and a footer.
        const ssrPage = nav.replace("valuesToReplace", "valuesToReplaceWith") + getSSR + footer; 
        
        
        app.get("/get-ssr", (req, res) {
            // send the HTML file (pass in a string)
            res.send(ssrPage);
        });
    </code>
</pre>
<p>
    As the above code illustrates, what is acutally passed to <em>res.send</em> is a string, which means you can
    also just write HTML directly in the a string without actually loading anything from files.
</p>
<h3>Serving static files</h3>
<p>
    In order for example client side JavaScript and CSS files in external files to work, the clint
    wil have to be able to fetch the files from the server. You do this by creating a folder on the server which you make
    publicly available, also known as static folders and static files. See the below for an example.  
</p>
<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        // make the directory named public at the root of the project static.
        // afterwards every file in the directory and its subdiretories will be public
        // and can be requested and fetched from the client.    
        app.use(express.static("public"));
    </code>
</pre>
<h3>Nodemon</h3>
<p>
    Normally you would run your Express server with the <em>node</em> command, but
    if you modify some code, the server will need to be restarted in order for the
    changes to have any effect. While you are developing the application, it can
    be annoying to have to restart the server so often. To solve this is issue, you can
    use a tool called Nodemon. Nodemon monitors for file changes in the project directory and
    restarts the application automaticallt if any changes are detected. That also means that you will
    use Nodemon to run the application while developing. To install a Nodemon, type <em>npm install nodemon</em>
    in a terminal. To run a file with Nodemon, run the command <em>Nodemon app.js</em> or whatever your main file
    is named.
