<h3>Variables in JavaScript</h3>
<p>
    In JavaScript you can use three different keywords to declare a variable: <br>
    - var <br>
    - let <br>
    - const
</p>

<h3>var</h3>
<p>
    Using var is the old way of writing JavaScript variables and is generally not recommened today.
    When you declare a variable with <em>var</em>, the variable is global unless written in a function, which
    means that is accessible from anywhere in the code. Variables declared with <em>var</em> is also always reassignable.
</p>

<h3>let and const</h3>
<p>
    Variables assigned with the <em>let</em> keyword are block scoped, which means that they are only
    accessible in the block or nested block which they are declared in. The difference between <em>let</em> and <em>const</em>
    is simply that variables declared with <em>let</em> are reassignable, while variables declared with <em>const</em> are not.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
    To illustrate the difference between <em>var</em> and <em>let</em>, consider the following code: <br>
</p>
<pre>
    <code class="language-javascript">
        {
            let a = 7;
        }
        console.log(a); // produces an error because a is not declared in this scope
        
        {
            var b = 7;
        }
        console.log(b); // prints 7
    </code>
</pre>
