    <h3>What is Node.js</h3>
    <p>
        Node.js is a JavaScript runtime which means that you can run JavaScript locally without
        a browser. A common use for Node.js is to create and run servers written in JavaScript.

    <h3>Setup and basics</h3>
    <p>
        First you need to download Node.js using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">this link</a>. 
        Choose the approriate download depending on your operating system and then click install and follow the onscreen instructions.
        To check if Node has been correctly installed, open a terminal and type <em>node --version</em>. If you see
        a version number, Node has been correctly installed.
    </p>
    <p>
        To run a JavaScript file, open a terminal and type <em>node [filename including extension]</em>. If for example your file is
        called <em>app.js</em>, then you would enter the command <em>node app.js</em>.
    </p>
    <p>Example "hello world" program to run:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
        console.log("Hello world");
    </code></pre>
    <h3>package.json</h3>
    <p>
        It is common to have a file called package.json in every Node project. package.json is a file formatted as JSON. The file can 
        contain dependencies, in which case the dependencies will be installed when you type <em>npm install</em> in a terminal. npm is 
        a package that was installed at the same time as Node.js. If you install a specific package via npm, the newly added dependency 
        will also appear in package.json. package.json can also include metadata about for example the name of your package, version and other 
        information. The file also contains the "main" property, which declares the main entry point of your package.
